    "p1": "The result of the analysis for this generic case, which connects two points located <strong>{{distancia}} km</strong> apart, is presented below.",
    "p2": "There is an efficiency threshold that determines the number of accumulated trips beyond which the GHG emissions from air transport, primarily derived from operation, would exceed those from rail transport, which mostly come from infrastructure construction. Until this threshold is reached, the accumulated emissions from air transport would be lower.",

    "p4": "In the following graph, you can see the accumulated emissions by the system in the proposed scenario, the emissions of each mode in that scenario, and for a hypothetical situation where only air transport is used."
