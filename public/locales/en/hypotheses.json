    "p3": "For the construction and maintenance phases of transport infrastructure, the \"Recommendations for the estimation of GHG emissions in the environmental assessment of transport plans and projects\", from the General Directorate for Environmental Quality and Assessment and Natural Environment of the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge of Spain, have been used as a common methodology.",

    "p5": "For the construction of High-Speed Rail, this report refers to three emission ranges:",
    "p6": "To determine the degree of terrain roughness in real cases, a proportionality criterion with the average construction costs of each section has been applied.",
