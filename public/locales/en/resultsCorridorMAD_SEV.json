    "p1": "This corridor allows for a longer analysis period, as Madrid - Seville was the first connection in Spanish HSR network, in 1992. The connection to Málaga was completed in 2007.",
    "p2": "The construction of the high-speed infrastructure is estimated to have generated 5.2 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e. In total, HSR has accumulated <strong>6.1 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e</strong>, which includes 11% operational emissions (up to 2019).",
    "p3": "The air mode accumulates <strong>3.4 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>e</strong> over the period.",
    "p4": "The accumulated volume of railway demand, increased by the growth of recent years, makes the accumulated <strong>emissions per railway passenger (48 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e)</strong> lower than those of each <strong>air passenger (90 kg CO<sub>2</sub>e).</strong>"
