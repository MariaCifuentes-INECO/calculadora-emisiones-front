    "p2": "<strong>How to Choose the Best Transportation Option?</strong> <br/>To connect two points with high travel demand, various transportation infrastructures and services can be developed. The key lies in economic efficiency, social profitability, and greenhouse gas emissions throughout their lifecycles.",
    "p3": "<strong>Air Transport:</strong> Most emissions come from operation, while construction has a lesser impact. To facilitate simulation and adapt it to user needs, a type of airport will be selected for point A and point B.",
    "p4": "<strong>High-Speed Rail:</strong> Construction generates high emissions, especially in rough terrains. However, electric traction powered with renewable energy allows for emission-free operation.",
    "p5": "The proposed values in some fields are based on averages from real cases, but you can customize them according to your needs."
